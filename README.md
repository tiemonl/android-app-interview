# Android App Interview Project

This is the interview base project for the Android App team.

### The Project

**Goal**: Build a Hacker News client that lists the top stories of the [news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/) website by using [their public API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API)

We will use two endpoints from the Hacker News API:
1. `topstories`  to get a list of item (story) IDs
2. `item`  to get the detail of each item (story)

### Guidelines
1. The **UI** should be **functional**, but it **does not have to be polished**; we are more interested that the app works, and your thought process.
2. We have provided the basic MVVM app architecture. **Feel free to use or *not* use the architecture provided** if you feel more comfortable with other architecture.
3. **Feel free to use the internet** to search for APIs, Stack Overflow, etc. We don't expect you to have every detail of every API memorized.
4. **Ask questions**! If you are unsure about any part of the boilerplate code, we would be more than happy to elaborate on how it is working.
